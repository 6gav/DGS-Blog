# DGS Blog

## Purpose of this project

This blog was created for use in my team's capstone months. The group will be making weekly blog posts and this was created to hold these posts.

## Technology

This uses a frontend designed with React.js communicating with a backend made in Node.js. The posts are sent to the backend which is then formatted and sent to a database. The main page retrieves the last ten posts from the backend and displays these.
